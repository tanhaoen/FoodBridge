# FoodBridge

## Description
FoodBridge connects individuals and businesses with excess food to those who need it. Through a simple interface, users can either offer or claim hot, ready-to-eat meals. The app serves dual purposes: it enables regular consumers and F&B businesses to share their surplus, and it empowers consumers and food banks to easily access these meals.
